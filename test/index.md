# Configuration
{: .no_toc }

Just the Docs has some specific configuration parameters that can be defined in your Jekyll site's \_config.yml file.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Table of contents
{: .no_toc .text-delta }

1. TOC
{:toc}

---

View this site's [\_config.yml](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/tree/main/_config.yml) file as an example.

## Site logo

```yaml
# Set a path/url to a logo that will be displayed instead of the title
logo: "/assets/images/just-the-docs.png"
```

## Site favicon

```yaml
# Set a path/url to a favicon that will be displayed by the browser
favicon_ico: "/assets/images/favicon.ico"
```

If the path to your favicon is `/favicon.ico`, you can leave `favicon_ico` unset.

## Search

```yaml
# Enable or disable the site search
# Supports true (default) or false
search_enabled: true

search:
  # Split pages into sections that can be searched individually
  # Supports 1 - 6, default: 2
  heading_level: 2
  # Maximum amount of previews per search result
  # Default: 3
  previews: 3
  # Maximum amount of words to display before a matched word in the preview
  # Default: 5
  preview_words_before: 5
  # Maximum amount of words to display after a matched word in the preview
  # Default: 10
  preview_words_after: 10
  # Set the search token separator
  # Default: /[\s\-/]+/
  # Example: enable support for hyphenated search words
  tokenizer_separator: /[\s/]+/
  # Display the relative url in search results
  # Supports true (default) or false
  rel_url: true
  # Enable or disable the search button that appears in the bottom right corner of every page
  # Supports true or false (default)
  button: false
  # Focus the search input by pressing `ctrl + focus_shortcut_key` (or `cmd + focus_shortcut_key` on macOS)
  focus_shortcut_key: 'k'
```

## Mermaid Diagrams
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

The minimum configuration requires the key for `version` ([from jsDelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/)) in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
mermaid:
  # Version of mermaid library
  # Pick an available version from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/
  version: "9.1.3"
```

Provide a `path` instead of a `version` key to load the mermaid library from a local file.



## Aux links

```yaml
# Aux links for the upper right navigation
aux_links:
  "Just the Docs on GitHub":
    - "//github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs"

# Makes Aux links open in a new tab. Default is false
aux_links_new_tab: false
```

## Navigation sidebar

```yaml
# Enable or disable the side/mobile menu globally
# Nav menu can also be selectively enabled or disabled using page variables or the minimal layout
nav_enabled: true
```

## Heading anchor links

```yaml
# Heading anchor links appear on hover over h1-h6 tags in page content
# allowing users to deep link to a particular heading on a page.
#
# Supports true (default) or false
heading_anchors: true
```

## External navigation links
{: .d-inline-block }

New (v0.4.0)
{: .label .label-green }

External links can be added to the navigation through the `nav_external_links` option.
See [Navigation Structure]({% link docs/navigation/main/external.md %}) for more details.

## Footer content

```yaml
# Footer content
# appears at the bottom of every page's main content
# Note: The footer_content option is deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. Please use `_includes/footer_custom.html` for more robust
markup / liquid-based content.
footer_content: "Copyright &copy; 2017-2020 Patrick Marsceill. Distributed by an <a href=\"https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/tree/main/LICENSE.txt\">MIT license.</a>"

# Footer last edited timestamp
last_edit_timestamp: true # show or hide edit time - page must have `last_modified_date` defined in the frontmatter
last_edit_time_format: "%b %e %Y at %I:%M %p" # uses ruby's time format: https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.0/libdoc/time/rdoc/Time.html

# Footer "Edit this page on GitHub" link text
gh_edit_link: true # show or hide edit this page link
gh_edit_link_text: "Edit this page on GitHub."
gh_edit_repository: "https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs" # the github URL for your repo
gh_edit_branch: "main" # the branch that your docs is served from
# gh_edit_source: docs # the source that your files originate from
gh_edit_view_mode: "tree" # "tree" or "edit" if you want the user to jump into the editor immediately
```

_note: `footer_content` is deprecated, but still supported. For a better experience we have moved this into an include called `_includes/footer_custom.html` which will allow for robust markup / liquid-based content._

- the "page last modified" data will only display if a page has a key called `last_modified_date`, formatted in some readable date format
- `last_edit_time_format` uses Ruby's DateTime formatter; for examples and information, please refer to the [official Ruby docs on `strftime` formatting](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/master/strftime_formatting_rdoc.html)
- `gh_edit_repository` is the URL of the project's GitHub repository
- `gh_edit_branch` is the branch that the docs site is served from; defaults to `main`
- `gh_edit_source` is the source directory that your project files are stored in (should be the same as [site.source](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/))
- `gh_edit_view_mode` is `"tree"` by default, which brings the user to the github page; switch to `"edit"` to bring the user directly into editing mode
